            <p>
                When I joined Gravitai, I came from a background of retail and sales and had no experience with any form of marketing automation. Although I did have good, self-taught, knowledge of HTML and basic CSS, I had never really applied any of this knowledge to a real-world project or scenario.
                <br><br>
                I was given the opportunity to work with Gravitai based on passing a probation period where I was required to be self sufficient and fast learning in order to hit the ground running when I was introduced to my first client, Just Eat.
                <br><br>
                For the time I was with Gravitai, I worked with Salesforce CRM and their Marketing Cloud platform to launch preference centres, rebrand client images and produce campaigns that were completely automated based on customer interactions

            </p>
            <h2>Clients</h2>
            <img class="img50vh" src="/img/clients.jpg">
            <p>
                Though I was employed directly by Gravitai, I had the pleasure of working with a variety of clients on the company's behalf. While my larger projects remain to be Just Eat and Schroders, I also provided support to team members who were assigned to other clients. 
                <br><br>
                My first client was Just Eat and it is here I learned about marketing automation, the power of a user's journey and how the two combined can really help drive a product with little effort. I took this knowledge with me to Schroders for almost two years - where I aided in launching a preference centre, running a global support platform, CRM and eventually, a marketing platform transition from Saleforce to Pardot.
                <br><br>
                My speciality with HTML in email saw me building email templates for the likes of ECCO and creating responsive content blocks for the marketing teams at Hays and Man United. While this seems straight forward, it's important to know that these reusable blocks were often being edited by marketing team members with little to no experience with code. 
                <br><br>
                As such, they were required to be responsive (where needed) and someone with no knowledge of code had to be able to easily populate a block with content, without trouble.

            <h2>Website</h2>

            <p>
               Between clients, I would work on the company website and I've seen it change a lot over my time with Gravitai and happy to have been part of this development process. I was able to freely work on improving areas of the site from layouts and optimisations to many of the forms and styles visiable publicly. During this time I was able to experiment with aspects of design and functionality as well as quality testing from a user point of view. As a quickly growing start-up company, it was important to me that potential clients would have the best experience when visiting the site and enquiring of the services.

            <h2>Blogs and creative writing</h2>

            <p>
                My background with retail management and running the social media for the last retail store I worked in, allowed me to be able to write a couple of pieces for the company blog. Interaction and engagement is important to me and it's very easy to forget that viewers can, and will, get bored of something very quickly unless they are actively being involved in what is happening there and then.<br><br>
            I like to focus on knowledge sharing pieces and produced a quick, 5 question interactive quiz along with a handy guide for new marketing users to reference when using Pardot</p>
