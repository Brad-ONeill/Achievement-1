            <p>
                I started with Ring on in 2021 and came onboard as the European CRM project manager.<br />
                The goal was simple: Increase devices per household within the European market.
                <br /><br />

                The idea was for the European marketing team to fully leverage a CRM platform "locally" and provide email based promotions to customers without requiring support from the overseas US team. This meant that localised content (both imagery and copy) could be handled in-house and took pressure off of the US team for support.
                <br /><br />

                My initial contract period was for 3 months, which was extended to a year. In Feburary 2022, my contract was extended again for another year but, due to Amazon's policy on the hiring of contractors, this was reduced to 3 months and sees my time with them coming to an in May.<br />
                However, my time with them taught me many new things such as the functionality of Braze (an ESP I had never used previously) to a new dynamic language, Liquid.
                <br /><br />
                My time with Ring has been highly engaging and an enjoyable work experience and certainly one I would like to experience again. However, allow me to cover what is now part of my repitoire.

            <p class="pad20">
                As previously mentioned, Ring use an ESP called Braze and this was completely new for me.<br />There was an urgency for me to get up to speed to enable the EU to send campaigns independantly and so, I learned everything I needed to know "on the job".
                <br /><br />
                While Braze differed quite a bit from what I was used to with Marketing Cloud, many of the features we actually easier to understanf and one of the more interesting elemetns was with the way dynamic content was created using a language know as Liquid.
                <br /><br />
                Braze was/is very easy to understand and it didn't take me long to get elbow deep into the functionality (and limitations) of the platform. It offers so fantastic support from my understanding and even created unique systems for Ring to ensure privacy was paramount

            <h1>Emails</h1>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>However, after my initial introduction, the first projects I got to tackle were promotional emails:</p>

        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                However, this was not the limit to their vision for the EU markets as many new products were also due for release
